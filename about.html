	<h1>About Mittens</h1>
	<img src="mittens.jpeg" width="640">
	<p>So, you're curious about me, eh? Well I don't blame you--I am <em>fascinating!</em></p>
	<p>
		After all, I'm a cat. But not only that, I am a computer genius! Every time I step on the keyboard, I log more keystrokes per second than anyone but the computer itself can count, lights start flashing on screens all around the room, and my hooman starts screaming in what could <em>only</em> be a jealous rage... and I've never even studied, it's just natural talent!
	</p>
	<p>
		But, as I'm sure you want to know more about me and what makes me tick {shudder! bad pun!}, I was born in 2016 along with two siblings, Gaia and Cornbread, to a single mom who lived across the river from NYC. Times were tough without a father figure around, and we had to grow up pretty quick. My sister Gaia and I left when we were only two months old ( I <em>am</em> a prodigy, ya know!), and we're still together.
